                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. 
                    Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at 
                    Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric 
                    water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce 
                    mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
